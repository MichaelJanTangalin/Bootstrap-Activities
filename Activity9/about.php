Anonymous is most widely known for its cyber-attacks against governments, government-affiliated groups, corporations, and the Church of Scientology. They are widely known for its cyber-attacks against governments, government-affiliated groups, corporations, and the Church of Scientology. The Members of the Anonymous community communicate and collaborate via social network services and encrypted Internet chat rooms. Individuals who wish to be recognized as part of the group in public wear Guy Fawkes masks in order to conceal their identities.

				To the extent Anonymous has a coherent ethos, it features decentralized communities interested in engaging in mutual goals. These goals have historically ranged from political statements to pranks and hacks, sometimes in retaliation for actions taken against the group itselfâ€”or those for whom members of a given operation feel an affinity.
