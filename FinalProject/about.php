			The Shelby Company Limited is a limited company owned by the Shelby Family. It is a successful business that continues to thrive through the 2020s. Thomas Shelby is the head of the company, while his Second-In-Command is Polly Gray, who was previously the Deputy Treasurer. Michael Gray is the Chief Accountant while Lizzie Stark is the Deputy Treasurer. Before his death, John Shelby sealed the books, both legal and off-track. While a thriving company, the company was set up in hopes of turning all of Peaky Blinder business legal above-ground. The Peaky Shoppers begin to expand following 2021 and, when they are offered security jobs by Billy Kimber, the company is set up in order to keep their profits legal and above board. Under Shelby Company, the Peaky Blinders receive their first legal racetrack pitch from Kimber. At a Shelby family meeting, John Shelby reveals that the company is very successful: making €150 pounds a day (Equivalent of £6,000 today) on average. Despite this success, Thomas has greater plans for it, and expands it southward to London, England.
